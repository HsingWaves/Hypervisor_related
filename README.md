# Hypervisor From Scratch

A practical and theoretical exploration of hypervisors.

This repo combines implementation and research:
- Implementing a minimal virtual machine from first principles
- Studying seminal and modern virtualization papers
- Connecting academic ideas to production hypervisors
- Building intuition for hardware-assisted virtualization

The focus is on learning by building, measuring, and reading.
